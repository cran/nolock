Description: Provides a suite of tools that can assist in enhancing the 
    processing efficiency of 'SQL' and 'R' scripts. 
    - The 'libr_unused()' retrieves a vector of package names that are called 
    within an 'R' script but are never actually used in the script.
    - The 'libr_used()' retrieves a vector of package names actively utilized 
    within an 'R' script; packages loaded using 'library()' but not actually 
    used in the script will not be included.
    - The 'libr_called()' retrieves a vector of all package names which are 
    called within an 'R' script.
    - 'nolock()' appends 'WITH (nolock)' to all tables in 'SQL' queries. This 
    facilitates reading from databases in scenarios where non-blocking reads are 
    preferable, such as in high-transaction environments.
